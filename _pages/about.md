I am currently a master student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), an enthusiastic Algorithm Engineer on a mission to revolutionize the realms of AI, computer vision, and deep learning. My journey in technology is fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a relentless drive to explore the uncharted territories of innovation. My research interests include **few-shot learning**, **3D point cloud learning**, **vision-language models**, and **multimodal large language models**.
